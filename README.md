# designing_and_creating_a_database

For this project, we're importing data into SQLITE, designing a database schema, creating tables, and inserting data into our schema.

This project will use data about Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet (found here: https://www.retrosheet.org/). The main file we will be working from, game_log.csv, has been produced by combining 127 separate CSV files from retrosheet, and has been previously cleaned to remove some inconsistencies.

Other files used from Retrosheet are park_codes.csv, person_codes.csv, and team_codes.csv
